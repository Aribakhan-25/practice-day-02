//1. Create two variables with different values with type "number" and then perform some operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)
 //by using arithmetic operators on them and print results with the help of console.log().



//Addition
let num1=9;
let num2=4

let sum=num1+num2
console.log(sum);


//substraction
let a=7;
let b=4;
let c=a-b;

console.log(c);

//multiplication
let eggs=12
let price=10


console.log(eggs*price)

//division
let students=1000
let passed=10
let remain=students/passed;

console.log(remain)
